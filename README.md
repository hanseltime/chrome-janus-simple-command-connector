# Chrome Extension API janus simple command connection

This repository provides a typescript wrapper and example scripts for abstracting away
the usage of the Chrome message passing APIs to the janus-simple-command Client/Server
paradigm.

Note, this repository is not currently well-tested and as such is not an npm package
for consumption (yet). Feel free to contribute tests or fixes so that we can release
this under a package for faster consumption.
